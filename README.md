# From zero to Python to AWS

In this repository you will find the code used in my Python and AWS course.

### Course structure
- [python_intro](python_intro/python.md)
- [lambda_intro](lambda_intro/lambda.md)
- [serverless](serverless/serverless.md)
- [terraform](terraform/terraform.md)
    

### python_intro
In this module we will learn the basics of programming in Python. 

We will start with the very basics of installing python and setting up our development environment. 
Then we will go on to creating our first “Hello world” application, 
and later get to learn about the concepts of conditionals, loops, functions and more.

The goal of this course is that you should have some basic knowledge of the topics mentioned above, 
and that you should be able to write some simple python applications yourself.


### lambda_intro
This module is aimed at developers how know the basics of writing python applications, 
and want to learn how create lambda functions using python.

We will make use of the AWS Console to write and publish our lambda functions. 
We will also make use of some AWS Services such as DynamoDB and SQS in our lambda functions, as well as connecting lambda functions to API gateways etc.

### serverless
Now we will learn how to create infrastructure as code (IaC) using the [Serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/). 
We will also learn how to deploy lambda functions using Serverless.


### terraform
In this module we will create infrastructure as code using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). We will also discuss how Terraform can be better than Serverless in some use cases.
