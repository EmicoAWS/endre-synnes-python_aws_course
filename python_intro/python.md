# Python

In this module we will learn the very basics of programming using the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/). We will start by installing Python on our computer, then talk about some core concepts in Python. Before we continue with some general programming concepts like; conditionals, loops, functions, etc.


### What is Python?
> Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. [1]

In my opinion, Python is a great programming language to get started with programming, as well as in general for more complex applications.

I use Python on a daily basis for developing serverless applications in some larger projects.
